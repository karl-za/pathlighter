# Running the project

## Step 1: Clone the repository

First, you need to download the project files from GitHub to your local machine.

Go to the GitHub repository page https://github.com/karl-za/pathlighter.git

Click the green "Code" button.

Copy the URL provided in the box (usually the HTTPS URL).

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to save the project.

Type `git clone` followed by the URL you copied and press Enter.

For example:

```git clone https://github.com/karl-za/pathlighter.git```

This command will create a local copy of the repository in a new folder.

## Step 2: Install dependencies

A Vite + React app has various dependencies (libraries and packages) that need to be installed before the app can run.

Navigate into the project directory you just cloned by using the cd command. For example, cd pathlighter

Run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in the project's package.json file:

```npm install```

This process may take a few minutes as it downloads all the necessary packages and saves them in a node_modules folder.

## Step 3: Start the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server to run the app.

In the same terminal window, run the following command:

```npm run dev```

This command will start the Vite development server, and you'll see a local URL (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/pathlighter`) in your terminal. You can open this URL in your web browser to see the running application.
